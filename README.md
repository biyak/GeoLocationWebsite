Add-ons:
  - Task1 
    - Included Facebook Open Graph
    - Included Twitter Cards
  - Task 2
    - Added the ability to attach a video to an object
    - Included an additional upload field so the user can upload a video
    - Used the `<picture>` and `<source>` tags to again provide at least two versions of the file'

Answer:
- i. The different versions of the graphics have two different resolutions. One is higher resolution for larger screen size and lower resolution for smaller screen size.
- ii. We can shave an average of 20% off page load times. and   It allows browser to choose the best image depending on the characteristics of the device <br> 
- iii. Worse in responsive image terms. We can add MIME types inside type attributes so the browser can immediately reject unsupported file types and response faster.
